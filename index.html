		  <p><img src='images/neenan.jpg' id="indexpic">I am currently an EngD postgraduate Researcher at the University of Southampton studying the impacts of noise pollution from marine transport and transport infrastructure on fish. </p>
		  <p> My background is in Biology and Animal Behaviour (BSc University of Exeter) and Biodiversity and Conservation (MSc University of Exeter, Cornwall Campus). Whilst completing my masters I collaborated with the National Lobster Hatchery in Padstow and conducted a study on the suitability of tagging for use in fisheries stock enhancement. Now with a fondness for working in conservation and sustainable fisheries research I have joined the EngD programme at the University of Southampton to help investigate the impacts of anthropogenic noise pollution on commercial fish populations. </p>

		  <p>Alongside my EngD I have completed a Postgraduate Certification in Business Administration, and am working towards my MBA.</P>

   <p>I became especially interested in marine conservation when I attended Farnborough 6th Form College where I undertook a PADI Open Water course in Egypt. Since then I have become fascinated with the underwater world, and want to help mitigate the impacts humans can have on marine ecosystems, and the implications of those impacts on the fisheries industries. </p>
      <p>Promoting public awareness of anthropogenic impacts is difficult. The easiest way to disseminate information is through online and social media, and so I learnt to code.</p>
      <p>Coding is now a huge part of my work and I want to enter a career in the tech industry.</p>

      <p>I am a keen coder with experience in several languages including: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, PHP, SQL, Ruby, and Python, and a basic knowledge of Linux.</p>
